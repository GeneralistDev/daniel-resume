      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an Australian living in Quito, Ecuador with my wife.
        I love developing software products and helping startups and established companies solve problems for customers.
        I'm constantly learning new technology and keeping my skills up to date, through personal projects, mentoring
        and attending events.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife Lis, playing computer games, watching movies,
        travelling and eating good food.

      <h5>Serverless Architectures</h5>
      <p>
        I worked in one of the world’s first fully serverless teams. We pioneered many of the best practices used today
        across the world via our Serverless Framework plugins as well as via the company blog at A Cloud Guru.
        We also gave lectures, workshops and demonstrations at the hugely successful Serverlessconf community
        conference which we ran around the world.
      </p>

      <h5>Building Software Solutions</h5>
      <p>
        Full stack developer and more. I’ve built on all layers of both traditional and microservice architectures.
        I have a wealth of AWS solutions architect and development experienced, having used over 80% of AWS
        product offerings in projects. I build software in my spare time for fun and love to learn new things. I have
        experience in a diverse set of languages including; C#, C/C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and Python;
        on Windows, Linux and Android.
      </p>

      <h5>Working in Teams</h5>
      <p>
        In my year and a half at Kiandra IT, I worked on many different project teams to deliver solutions to the
        company’s clients. The company implemented a strong mentoring system which allowed me to experience
        working in full software teams in the PM, BA, QA, UX and Developer roles. Kiandra has a strong Agile
        culture which I have had the opportunity to be fully immersed in whilst working there.
      </p>

      <h5>Customer Service</h5>
      <p>
        In all previous jobs I have worked in a strongly customer focused role. I have excellent people skills and a
        keen eye for detail which allows me to solve problems for customers and look beyond their frustrations, wants
        and desires to deliver them what they really need to solve their problem. I enjoy working with people and
        communicating as part of my job and love to work in strong coherent teams.
